# Text Editor PWA

## Description

This app is a text editor that uses indexdb to allow a user to use it fully offline. It follows practices for progressive web apps (PWA) to be downloaded on the user's system.

- My motivation for this app was to have a web app that can be downloaded for offline use.
- I built this project to gain experience with PWA's and learn how they work.
- This solves the problem of requiring an internet connection to use the app.
- I learned about how service workers work and the benefits of indexdb.
